# You are the HR manager of a company with 1000 employees numbered for 1 to 1000. Your boss told you to give a big Christmas bonus to employees, but didnâ€™t tell you their names. Instead they gave you two indications:

# 1) the sum of the proper divisors (including 1 but not itself) of the employee number is greater than the employee number itself

# 2) no subset of those divisors sums to the employee number itself.

# How many employees are eligible for the bonus and what are their number?

# For example:
# - Number 12: the proper divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6. The sum is 1+2+3+4+6 = 16 which is greater than 12 and matches the first condition. However, the subset 2+4+6=12 which violates the second condition.
